# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Naive-Bayes
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. The goal of sentiment analysis is to understand and interpret the subjective information present in the text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. In the context of sentiment analysis, text can be any form of written content, such as reviews, social media posts, comments, articles, or customer feedback. The analysis involves using computational methods and algorithms to automatically classify the sentiment of the text as positive, negative, or neutral.

In this sentiment analysis project, we leverage the power of the Naive Bayes algorithm along with the TF-IDF vectorizer for effective feature extraction. The undertaking involves a systematic series of steps, meticulously crafted to comprehend and categorize sentiments within textual data. Our journey commences with the importation of essential libraries, paving the way for a seamless execution of the sentiment analysis workflow.
